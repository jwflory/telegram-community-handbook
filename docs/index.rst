*************************
Outline: Work in progress
*************************

This project is a work in progress to document my lessons learned and advice on running Telegram communities.
Here is how I want to split this up:

- About
    - What is this
    - Who is it for
    - How to contribute
- Telegram groups
    - Making an appealing group
    - Moderation tools / bots
    - Organization over time
- Community management practices
    - Advice for running small, medium, and large groups

Possibly more!
